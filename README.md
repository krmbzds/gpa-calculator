gpa-calculator
==============

Quick & dirty GPA calculator. Saves data into a local sqlite database. Gives pretty table output.


#### Use case scenario

You want to calculate your semester GPA. Shit's messed up because some of your professors didn't enter your grades on time (therefore they're not appearing on your transcript). You know your grades and want to make a quick calculation. You also want to add new grades as they're announced. Then [gpa-calculator](https://github.com/krmbzds/gpa-calculator)'s got you covered.
